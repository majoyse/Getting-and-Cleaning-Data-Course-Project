Coursera Data Science Module 3, Week 4: Getting and Cleaning Data 


This repository contains the code book, R program and final output for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The R program "run_analysis.R" accesses files containing data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  A full description of the data is available at:

	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data itself is located at:

	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The program is written to acces all the needed files from the same directory.  Only 1 R package is required.  That package is shown in the R program.


A code book named "CodeBook.md" is included to summarize the files used and transformations done to the data.
